# Arcade Game Emulator
 This program is a testament to my deep understanding and mastery of that language. It contains three different games within itself, each with its own scoring system, sounds, pictures, style, music, start screen, and end screen. The games are all interactive, and visual, they are like you are looking at a real arcade screen, they are not text-based games where you have to write something which would go through a series of if-else statements which would thus making your action happen.

 # Requirements
- [Python >= 3.7.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)

# Setting Up
Once you have cloned the repo onto your local machine, you will need to install pip3 and pygame into your machine along with the repo as without those two packages the program will not run. Before you can go ahead and install pygame, you will require to have pip3 preinstalled. You can install pip3 using the instructions provided in the link above. Once you have pip3, you can begin the process of installing pygame, which much like pip3 can be installed easily using the instruction in the link above. Once those packages have been installed onto your computer, you can now run the script.
