# Arcade Game Emulator
 This program is a testament to my deep understanding and mastery of that language. It contains three different games within itself, each with its own scoring system, sounds, pictures, style, music, start screen, and end screen. The games are a quiz game, a number guessing game, and an imitation of the popular arcade classic, Whack-a-mole. I have implemented a complete graphical user interface, allowing all application elements to be accessed using the click of one's mouse.

 ### Pre-requisites
- Python >= 3.7.4
- pip3
- pygame

### Setting Up
Once you have cloned the repo onto your local machine, you will need to install pip3 and pygame into your machine along with the repo as without those two packages the program will not run. Before you can go ahead and install pygame, you will require to have pip3 preinstalled. You can install pip3 using the instructions provided in the link above. Once you have pip3, you can begin the process of installing pygame, which much like pip3 can be installed easily using the instruction in the link above. Once those packages have been installed onto your computer, you can now run the script.
